    <h3>Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, wanders through the slums of St. Petersburg and
        commits a random murder without remorse or regret. He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napolean: acting 
        for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse
        with a suspicious police investigator, Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds
        the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. Only Sonya, a downtrodden prostitute, can offer him 
        the chance of redemption.
